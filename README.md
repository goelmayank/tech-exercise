# Apollo/React Exercise

This is the fullstack exercise ðŸš€

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:

- `start`: Starting point for the exercise

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
